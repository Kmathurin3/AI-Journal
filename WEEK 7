This week, I used AI primarily to stay organized and complete a few tasks faster. 
I asked for help breaking down some study topics, rewriting a few notes to make them easier to understand, and ensuring that my writing sounded clear and natural.
I also used it to plan out how to phrase a few messages and to simply talk through my ideas when I was stuck. 
It's been useful for explaining things clearly and staying focused when I'm busy. I didn't rely on it for complete answers, but rather for clarification and small boosts as needed.
