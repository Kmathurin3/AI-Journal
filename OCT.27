This week, I used AI to help me understand some Python concepts we've been learning in class. 
I was confused about how instance, class, and static methods work, so I asked ChatGPT to explain it to me. 
It explained it step by step and provided short code examples to help me understand it.

I also used it to double-check that the methods I wrote made sense and were written properly.Â 
I used it as a guide when I got stuck or wanted to see what I was missing.

Using AI in this manner made my work easier to understand, rather than simply copying code.
