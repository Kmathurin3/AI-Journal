This week, I used AI mostly for general assistance while finishing my assignments. 
When I got stuck, I asked a few questions to make sure I was on track. It helped me stay organized and understand directions better. 
I still did the work myself, but AI made the process more efficient and less stressful. 
Overall, I used it as a useful study tool rather than to replace my own work.
