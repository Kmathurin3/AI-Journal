This week, I mainly used AI to stay organized and make sure that I understood what my assignments required. 
I used it to break down confusing instructions, simplify wording, and rewrite things so they still sounded like me. I
t was extremely helpful when I needed quick clarification without having to sift through long notes or slides.
I also used AI to assess my understanding of specific concepts in my classes. 
Instead of giving me complete answers, it helped explain why something works the way it does, allowing me to complete the work on my own.
I used it several times for communication drafts to ensure that my messages were clear and respectful.
