This week, I used AI to assist me with short Python exercises for my INST326 class.
It walked me through the process of creating and testing classes, writing instance methods, and employing basic logic such as conditions and loops. 
I primarily used it to double-check my work, confirm syntax, and understand the structure of object-oriented code.
AI helped me stay organized and confident in my code by providing quick explanations and corrections that did not overcomplicate things.
Overall, it simplifies and speeds up my learning process.
