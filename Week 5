This week, I mainly used AI for academic support and organization.
I asked AI  to help me with reviewing class material, polishing written responses, and improving the clarity of my project notes. 
When writing discussion posts, I used AI to double-check structure and tone so that my writing sounded natural while also meeting the assignment's expectations.
I also used it as a study aid to explain key terms and examples from lecture slides in simpler terms.
This helped me understand concepts faster and prepare for upcoming quizzes. 
Overall, AI improved my productivity and gave me confidence that my writing and comprehension were on track.
