This week I used AI mainly as a support tool to help me stay organized while working through a bigger programming task. 
I used it to think through how different parts of a system should connect and to better understand features like saving and loading data, importing and exporting files, and handling errors without overcomplicating things.
It helped me break everything down so I didn’t feel overwhelmed.

I also used AI to get clearer on different types of testing and when each one makes sense. 
That helped me focus more on testing full workflows instead of just small pieces of code, especially when files are involved.

Lastly, I used AI to help organize explanations and documentation. It helped with structure and clarity, but everything ultimately reflects my own understanding and decisions.
