This week, I used AI as a quick reference while working on Python practice. 
I asked for help understanding a few concepts, such as inheritance and polymorphism, and I checked a few code patterns to make sure I was following the instructions correctly.
I still wrote the code myself, but AI helped me confirm the structure and reminded me of the proper syntax when I got stuck.
