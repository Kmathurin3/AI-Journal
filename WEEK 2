Week 2
This week, I used AI a little for school. 
I mostly used it to help explain some Python concepts that were initially confusing, such as conditionals, loops, and lists. 
It was helpful to see short examples, and it sped up my practice. 
I also used it for a few exercises to ensure I was on the right track, but I didn't expect it to do everything for me. 
I didn't need to use it for debugging because my code was functional after testing it. 
Overall, I used AI as a learning tool and quick reference, rather than the primary method for completing the work.
