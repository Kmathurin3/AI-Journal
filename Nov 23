This week, I used AI primarily to help me stay organized and better understand my assignments. 
I asked for assistance in summarizing instructions, breaking down tasks, and explaining concepts in simpler terms so that I could focus on doing the work rather than feeling overwhelmed.
AI also assisted me in writing and revising short pieces of text, such as emails or brief explanations, thereby facilitating communication. 
I made certain that the ideas remained my own and only used AI to clarify or structure what I already intended to say. Overall, AI improved my workflow, saved me time, and made me feel more confident about approaching assignments without replacing my own thinking or effort.
